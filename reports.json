    "text": "ngl lately my brain been acting weird af 😵‍💫 like I wake up already tired, not even “oh I didn’t sleep well” tired, more like mentally drained for no damn reason. alarm goes off and I’m already thinking “here we go again” 🙃 I just lay there scrolling reels, half laughing, half dead inside. everyone online be living their best life fr, gym grind, hustle quotes, vacation pics, glowing skin, winning vibes 💀 meanwhile I’m struggling to even reply “haha” to messages. #lowbattery #mentallydone\n\nsome days I’m chill tho. like actually fine. joking around, vibing with music, feeling a bit normal 🎶✨ and then boom… mood switch for no reason. no trigger, no drama, just my brain saying “nah we sad today.” that’s the worst part honestly, not knowing why. people see me laughing and think I’m okay, but bro smiling is easy, explaining your mind is not. I say “I’m good” on autopilot. feels easier than unpacking all this mess. #fakefine #moodswings\n\nnight time hits different 🌙 that’s when overthinking goes crazy. random memories pop up, dumb mistakes, awkward convos from YEARS ago like why are you here now?? 😭 I start comparing myself to everyone I know. same age, same background, but they’re moving ahead and I’m just… stuck. I try to sleep but my mind is running marathons. phone at 2%, brain at 200%. even when I do sleep, I wake up feeling like I didn’t rest at all. #nightbrain #insomniavibes\n\nI be feeling lonely even when people around me. sitting in a group but feeling invisible. talking but not really connecting. it’s like I’m there physically but mentally somewhere else. I want someone to just get it without me explaining every little thing. and then I feel bad for feeling bad because “others have it worse” yeah okay but that doesn’t magically fix my head bro. guilt on top of sadness is a nasty combo. #lonelyaf #mentalguilt\n\nI try to fix myself, fr. motivational videos, podcasts, planners, to-do lists, “new mindset” every monday 💪 but some days brushing teeth feels like a mission. I start tasks, lose focus, then hate myself for not finishing. not lazy, just empty. energy randomly disappears. and the more unproductive I feel, the worse my mood gets. it’s a loop and I hate it. #burnoutmode #stuckcycle\n\nstill… I haven’t completely given up. there’s a tiny part of me that’s like “hold on a bit more.” some days are trash, some are okay, some confusing af. I don’t need life to be perfect, I just want my mind to chill a little. less noise, less self-hate, more peace. till then I’m just surviving one day at a time. might not look strong, but I’m still here. and I guess that counts for something. 🖤 #stillhere #onedayatime #mentalhealthtalk #realnotperfect",

    "text": "This is me. Junaid. And honestly… I’m not okay today 😔 I don’t even know how to start this, but my chest feels heavy and my mind won’t shut up 🧠💭 People keep asking, “You good?” and I keep saying “Yeah, I’m fine” 🙂 But the truth? The truth is I’m tired. Like… soul‑tired 🫠\n\nSome days it feels like my life is on mute 🔇 Everyone’s moving forward, leveling up, living their best life… and I’m just standing still, watching time pass ⏳ Overthinking everything, replaying old moments, stressing about a future that feels blurry and empty 🌫️\n\nI try to be strong 💪 I really do. But every day I feel like I’m breaking a little more inside… quietly 🥀 No one notices. No one asks the real questions. Lonely even in a room full of people 👤\n\nSometimes I wonder if I’m the problem 🤡 Like maybe I feel too much, think too much, care too much Certified overthinker, no breaks 😵‍💫 Music helps… sometimes 🎧 Other times it just hits harder, like it understands my pain a little too well 😭 Sad songs on repeat. Dark vibes only 🖤\n\nPeople say “just move on” Like it’s that easy 😔 Like thoughts have an off switch Like memories don’t haunt you at 3am 🌙 Pressure, expectations, responsibilities… it all piles up And suddenly breathing feels heavy 😮‍💨\n\nI hate opening up because I don’t want to be a burden 😞 So I joke instead 🤡 I smile instead 🙂 I pretend I’m chill, unbothered, okay Everyone thinks Junaid’s cool, funny, relaxed They don’t see the nights I stare at the ceiling, feeling empty 🛌\n\nSome days I feel completely lost 🧭 No motivation. No energy. No direction. Just existing, not really living ⚰️ I don’t want to disappear from life… I just want the pain to pause for a while 💭\n\nI wish people understood that depression isn’t always crying Sometimes it’s numbness Sometimes it’s silence Sometimes it’s laughing too loud to hide how broken you feel inside 🎭\n\nIf you’re reading this and it feels familiar… Just know this is Junaid’s heart talking — raw, messy, real 🤍 And maybe… you’re not alone either\n\n#JunaidSpeaks #HeartTalk #DepressedVibes #SadBoiHours #MentalHealth #TiredAF #Overthinking #LonelyNights #BrokenInside #MaskingPain #FeelsBadMan #EmptyInside #MentalHealthMatters #RealFeelings #HeavyHeart #SilentStruggles #LostThoughts #EmotionalDrain #LifeIsHard #VentPost #NotOkay #DarkVibes #HealingSlowly",
